                    <p>
                        Predator is a composite ability composed of multiple sub-abilities. It also grants spell slots to allow the casting of spells gained from Analysis.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To determine the spell slots granted by Predator, first calculate your total spellcaster level from all classes and features other than Predator using the standard multiclassing rules.
                        Predator then contributed additional spellcaster levels equal to half the number of your remaining character levels (rounded down).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Predator spells.
                        You use your Wisdom whenever a Predator spell refers to your spellcasting ability.
                        In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a Predator spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

                                As an action, you attempt to engulf a creature within your reach by flowing over and partially enclosing it.
                                The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or become engulfed by you.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The save DC equals <b>8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier</b>.

                            <p>
                                You can have only one creature engulfed at a time.
                                While a creature is engulfed, you cannot take actions other than releasing the creature.
                                Releasing an engulfed creature requires no action.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                While engulfed, the creature is partially restrained by your body.
                                If the engulfed creature is <b>your size or larger</b>, its speed is reduced by 10 feet.
                                If the engulfed creature is <b>strictly smaller</b> than you, its speed becomes 0.
                                The engulfed creature can take actions normally, including attacks, spellcasting, and other abilities.
                                <i>It is not required to attempt to escape.</i>
                            </p>

                                When a creature becomes engulfed, and at the start of each of your turns, the engulfed creature takes Acid damage equal to
                                <b>1d6 + your Constitution modifier</b> (increasing by <b>1d6 at <abbr title="player levels 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, and 19">every odd player level starting at 3rd</abbr></b>).

                                The engulfed creature is not shielded from attacks.
                                When either you or the engulfed creature takes damage from an external source, both of you take the damage.
                                Damage is rolled once and applied to both creatures.
                            </p>

                                An engulfed creature can use its action to attempt to force itself free.
                                The creature makes a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check, contested by your Strength (Athletics) check.
                                <br>
                                On a success, the creature frees itself from you, forcing you off its body and moving you to an unoccupied space of its choice within 5 feet of it.
                                This movement does not provoke opportunity attacks.

                                Whenever you kill a creature using Predation, Analysis automatically activates if it still has uses left.
                                <br>
                                At the start of play, your list of Analyzed creatures contains only <b>Half-Elf</b> (reason for this is explained in the lore).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Analysis has a limited number of uses, starting at <b>2 uses</b>, and increasing by <b>1 use at 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th player level</b>.
                                You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Once Analysis triggers, your concentration is broken, and you cannot take actions during the turn it triggers or during your next turn.
                                <br>
                                The benefits of Analysis are not gained immediately, they only become available after you complete your next short rest (finishing the Analysis).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When you finish Analyzing a creature, the following happens:
                            </p>

                                        You learn all spells the creature knows.
                                        If a spell can normally be cast only a limited number of times per day, you can instead cast it that amount of times per long rest.

                                        If an action has a recharge value, it retains that recharge value.
                                        If an action can be used only a limited number of times per day, you can instead use it that amount of times per long rest.

                                You can use your action to transform into any creature you have Analyzed.
                                During this transformation you may grow or replace wings, but only with wings belonging to a creature you have Analyzed.

                                        Your movement speed is replaced by that of the Mimicked form.
                                        If you added or changed the wings of that Mimicked form, you get the flying speed of the creature the wings are from.

                                        Your ability to take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of the Mimicked form.
                                        Transforming doesn't break your concentration on a spell you've cast.

                                        You choose whether your equipment enters the Stomach or is worn by your new form.
                                        Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature's shape and size.
                                        Your equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must enter the Stomach.
