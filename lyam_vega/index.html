                                <!--Birth-->
                                <p>
                                    Lyam Vega was born into an upper-middle-class family.
                                    His mother, a gentle and skilled human druid, nurtured life with her magic and heart,
                                    while his father, a brilliant but stern human artificer, harnessed arcane forces to create and innovate.
                                    However, his infernal heritage as a tiefling set him apart from the moment he was born.
                                    While his mother embraced him, recognizing the soul beneath the horns and tail, his father saw only a curse—a stain on his otherwise perfect life.
                                    Unable to reconcile his shame with his family’s reality, Lyam’s father abandoned them shortly after his birth.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Despite this, his childhood was relatively normal. The love of his mother and older sister shielded him from the harshness of the world.
                                    His sister, still too young to fully understand their father’s absence, became his closest companion.
                                    She often promised that when she grew up to be a fighter, she'd protect him from anything life could throw at them.
                                </p>

                                <!--Before Attack-->
                                <p>
                                    Growing up in a bustling city, Lyam’s life mirrored that of any other human child—at least on the surface.
                                    He and his sister, inseparable, spent their days practicing swordplay in the woods, imagining themselves as legendary warriors.
                                    She was his inspiration and his fiercest supporter, pushing him to chase his dream of becoming a great fighter.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The prejudice against tieflings was present but muted during these years, drowned out by the comfort of his home and the strength of his familial bonds.
                                    He thrived in his little world, dreaming of proving himself one day—not just as a fighter, but as someone who could overcome the infernal shadow of his lineage.
                                </p>

                                <!--Attack-->
                                <p>
                                    That dream was shattered one fateful night.
                                    A shadowy assassin, hired for reasons still unknown, broke into their home.
                                    Lyam awoke to chaos—his mother’s screams and the unmistakable clash of steel in the hall.
                                    Despite his budding skills, he was still a child, powerless to stop the rogue as they struck down his mother.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The assassin turned their blade on him, delivering a swift, brutal blow that severed his arm.
                                    As pain and shock overwhelmed him, he scrambled backward, trying desperately to escape.
                                    In his panicked retreat, the assassin cornered him and struck again, severing his leg.
                                    Weak and helpless, he had no choice but to crawl toward the only opening left to him—the door to his father’s old study, which the assassin’s strike had forced open.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Inside, amidst the cluttered remains of a forgotten life, he found salvation.
                                    An incomplete piece of arcane propulsion armor lay discarded in a dusty corner.
                                    With the assassin closing in, Lyam stretched out his remaining arm, bloodied fingers brushing against the magical apparatus.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The armor’s enchantments activated instantly, responding to his desperate touch.
                                    Arcane energy crackled through the room, fusing the armor to his broken body in a burst of light.
                                    The shockwave startled the assassin, forcing them to retreat.
                                    Though alive, Lyam collapsed unconscious, the remnants of the armor now a part of him.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    When he awoke, his world had changed forever.
                                    His mother was gone, his body forever altered, and his sister—now his only family—pulled him from the ruins of their shattered home.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    The attack left scars far deeper than the ones on his body.
                                    With his mother gone and their home no longer safe, his sister found them a small, unassuming place to live, far from where their lives had been torn apart.
                                    For Lyam, returning to the old house was too dangerous—but he braved it once, sneaking back to retrieve the books from his mother’s study.
                                    Her collection of texts on druidic magic and the natural world became a quiet source of comfort in the uncertain days that followed.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    To make ends meet, Lyam took a job at a local blacksmith’s shop.
                                    The blacksmith, harboring the same prejudice that plagued much of society, saw him as nothing more than a tiefling and underpaid him for his labor.
                                    However, they hired him because of the assumptions made about his arcane prosthetics, mistaking him for an artificer.
                                    While this allowed him to secure work, it left him trapped between unfair treatment and the need to keep up appearances.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    In public, Lyam wears a cloak to hide his horns and tail—those physical markers of his infernal heritage that are often met with suspicion, fear, or outright hostility.
                                    The cloak offers him a small measure of privacy and protection, but it’s also a constant reminder that his presence in the world is never fully accepted.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    His metallic arm and leg were both a blessing and a curse.
                                    While they allowed him to survive, they also marked him as an oddity and a reminder of his father’s abandonment.
                                    In stolen moments of quiet, he would retreat to his mother’s books, reading her words and trying to find a connection to the life he had lost.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Though he longs for the safety and happiness of his childhood, he knows deep down it’s gone forever.
                                    His sister remains his anchor, her determination giving him the strength to push forward despite the challenges they face.
                                    Yet in the quiet moments, as he pores over his mother’s writings, he begins to feel the faint stirrings of something new—a spark within, waiting to ignite like wildfire.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    (Lyam quits his job at the blacksmith because he got tired of getting underpaid and treated harshly)

                                    Lyam is a fighter and learning how to fight, but while going through that he tries to decipher his mother's books which is hard since Druidic can only be learned if another Druid teaches you (typically anyway).
                                    Then one day he figures it out and slowly grows this ability which then manifests itself in a wildfire spirit with the appearance of a ferret (Lyam's comfort animal).
                                    Then after that they learn to be a cohesive fighting team as he takes more levels in fighter and druid.
